# Electricity Demand Forecasting

**Business Context**:  
A leading electricity distribution company seeks to accurately forecast electricity demand for the next 1-2 years. This will aid in managing electricity production and vendor coordination effectively.

**Available Data**:  
Monthly electricity consumption data from January 1973 to December 2019, measured in Trillion Watts.

**Business Objectives**:  
1. Forecast monthly electricity demand for the next 1-2 years.  
2. Evaluate forecast accuracy using error metrics such as RMSE, RMSPE, and MAPE.  
3. Compare different forecasting models (Decomposition, ETS, ARIMA/SARIMA) to identify the best-performing one.

**Expected Outputs**:  
1. Detailed, well-documented code.  
2. Validation and accuracy metrics for the models.  
3. Monthly demand estimates for the forecasted period.  
4. Justification for the selected forecasting model based on performance.
